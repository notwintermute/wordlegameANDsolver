# wordlegameANDsolver
working wordle game with solver ai thing  
  
The wordle game works (picks a random word from the ny times list of possible answers)  
The ai is incredibly slow and unoptimized (and my code is ugly and unruly)  
this will probably change if I ever stop being tired of this lol  
Click the box in the upper right and press enter to enter in your guess  
Press d to make the code suggest a word (WARNING this takes a very long time if there's more than 200 possible words)  
Press t to automatically enter in the suggested word  
Press r to make it randomly show you a possible word (good for being lazy while testing)  
read the code (in all its uncommented glory) if you want to get an aneurysm
